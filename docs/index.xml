      <description>The WhiskyA tremendous selection of fine bourbons, scotches, and other whisky, not to mention some great wine and everything youneed to make delicious cocktails.
You&#39;re guaranteed to find something tasty.Everyone is required to bring at least one bottle of something they enjoy so the selection is always interesting. Mostpeople bring more, and there&#39;s a good assortment provided. We even made an app to keep track of it all.</description>
